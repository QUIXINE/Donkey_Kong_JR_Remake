# Donkey Kong JR

`I did this project with two of my friends. I am responsible for main most of the mechanic programming part except for the movement of enemies like the red fish. This is one of a fun project because I have to figure out each mechanics works. The most funniest and challenging part is making Donkey Kong Jr (player) to move on the vine and rope. There are times that it seems to work but when I try it again it doesn't look the sameðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£. Well, it's quite challenging, but after finishing the project and look back, it's kinda fun you know.`
